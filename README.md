# Telangana Groundwater Quality Dashboard

Analyzed **2018â€“2020 Telangana groundwater data (district, mandal, village)** from **Kaggle**. Built a **7-page interactive Power BI dashboard** with maps, bar charts, donut charts, gauges, and filters to assess **drinkability and irrigability** across multiple parameters.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Ground Water Of Telangana.pbix` | Full interactive Power BI report (open in Power BI Desktop). |
| `images` | Screenshots of the dashboard for preview. |
| `README.md` | Project description and documentation. |

## Key Features

1. 7-page interactive Power BI dashboard  
2. Dynamic filters: **maps, bars, donuts, gauges, field parameters**  
3. Analysis of drinkability and irrigability. 
4. Parameters: Groundwater level, pH, Electrical Conductivity, TDS, Total Hardness, SAR, RSC, and ions/elements like Sodium, Carbonate, Bicarbonate, Fluoride, Chloride, Nitrate, etc.  
5. Insights for water resource management, policy planning, and environmental research.

## Notes

- Ensure your **Power BI Desktop version supports all visuals** used in the dashboard.   
- Dataset is from **Kaggle**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sivapriyagarladinne/telangana-post-monsoon-ground-water-quality-data]
